# Study Computer Science
This repo mainly serves as a revision for Computer Science, including some programming languages, computer science knowledges and practical settings. As I described in the description, this repo records the concepts I think is useful and essential when I review some books or learn new skills.

**Note that you cannot use this repo to learn related topics.** Because the concepts I put in the related section in this repo are essential ones not the whole concepts of some skill or architecture, base on this the concepts in this repo are not continous or systematic. You might read books of related topic first and use this repo as a tool to keep yourself remembering the essential or advanced knowledges of that.

**Also if you find anything incorrect, feel free to correct me.**
